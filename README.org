   To run the server locally

   #+begin_src sh
     yarn frontend
   #+end_src
   
   This will reset the development database and fill it with seed data, as well
   as launch the server on port 3500. Note that this will discard any existing
   data.
   
   To set the server to a different port, set the environment variable ~ENV~ to
   the desired number. This can be done using your operating systems method of
   choice, or by using a ~.env~ file in the project's root.
